# Quantitative Analysis of Dihedral Angle Variability in Protein Structures

This repository contains the pipeline and scripts used in the study titled "Quantitative Analysis of Dihedral Angle Variability and Structural Compensation in Diverse Protein Families."

## Project Overview
The project aims to quantify the variability of backbone dihedral angles in proteins using Shannon entropy and investigate compensatory structural mechanisms.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- PyMOL (for structural alignment and visualization)
- SciPy, BioPython, and other required libraries (listed in `requirements.txt`)

## Installation
Clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies:
