# Protein Conformational Analysis Pipeline

This pipeline quantifies conformational variability in protein families using Shannon Entropy and correlates it to various metrics such as average RMSD, B-factors, and relative SASA.

## System Requirements
- Python 3.x
- PyMOL
- BioPython
- Required Python libraries (see `requirements.txt`)

## Data Availability
Currently, the data and results generated by this pipeline are under embargo and will be made available once the work is published in a peer-reviewed journal. For inquiries or requests prior to publication, please contact the repository maintainer.
